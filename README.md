❄️ Snowflake Projects
This repository contains a collection of structured scripts demonstrating an end-to-end data pipeline implementation using Snowflake. It's ideal for showcasing your SQL, data modeling, and ETL skills—especially for internship prep!

📂 Repository Structure
- Clean_data – Script to clean raw datasets
- Data_Pipline – Main data pipeline orchestration
- Fact_dimantion – Creation of fact tables and relationships
- Raw_Zone – Initial data staging logic
- Schema_creation – Schema setup and configuration
- date_dim – Generation of date dimension table
- facts – ETL logic for final fact table

🚀 Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/Prajwal2112/snowflake.projects.git cd snowflake.projects

🔧 Usage Guide
Run the files in this recommended order:
- Schema_creation
- Raw_Zone
- Clean_data
- date_dim
- Fact_dimantion
- facts
- Data_Pipline (to orchestrate the complete flow)
Each script reflects an ETL stage contributing to clean and optimized consumption-ready data.

🏗️ Project Goals
- Build robust ETL pipelines
- Master Snowflake's role and schema management
- Work with real-world datasets (e.g. sports/cricket data)
